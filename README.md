A simple benchmarking app for testing your phone processor. The test consists in solving this operation:

$$ f(x)=-2x(2)+{11x \over 3} $$

This evaluates the function in interval {-10, 10} with precise increments, from 0.000001 to 0.0000000001.

# Why PokéToaster?

Welp... the story begins in an Android application development class, when 2 friends were arguing about which phone had a better processor and after a class of algorithms, the solution came to light.

Poké = Pocket & Toaster = Computer then Pocket Computer.
